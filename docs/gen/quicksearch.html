It can be used with CommonJs, AMD, or SystemJs. Just decide which module system works for you and import clarity-animation. This also means that if you use transpilers like Babel or Typescript you can also use it. Even if you don't use a module system you can still use clarity-animation. It will detect that there isn't any module system and assign clarityAnimation to the global object. So go out and make applications prettier. Happy animating! Clarity Animation MissionThe clarity-animation package wants to solve your complicated animation needs in simplest of patterns. Making a application beautiful shouldn't be hard. So if there is a better way to describe animations and timelines let us know, and lets have a great conversation. Animations vs TimelinesIn clarity-animation there are two basic things you need to use, the Animation classes and Timeline classes. The animation class gives you the ability to describe the properties to change, the easing, and the duration. We found early on in our development we needed to be able to compose animations with different easings and durations. Timelines answer that problem. They allow you to compose animations together in a way that gaurantees the animations to remain in sync with one another, forward or backward. Since Timelines are really animations, this also means you can compose timelines with in timelines. Really the complexity of the animations is limitless but the ease of composing them is simple. ExamplesWith in the clarity-animation package is an example folder. Please browse through the examples. It will teach you many things that documentation wont. They also provide a foundation of ideas that can be used while building animations. Whats included? Animation CssAnimation CustomRenderAnimation ElementAnimation ElementPathAnimation Timeline PercentageTimeline There are seven different classes to make animations with. There is the root class Animation, from which all classes are derived. CustomRenderAnimation which allows you to provider a custom renderer. CssAnimation animates an object with properties that resemble css names and understands the units involved with those property names. ElementAnimation animates elements. ElementPathAnimation animates elements through bezier curves with points and controls. Timeline allows you to compose many animations into a concert of animations using offsets. PercentageTimeline does the same as the Timeline but instead uses the principles of startAt and endAt to compose the animations. Clarity Animationnpm install clarity-animationAdd a index.html file to the directory so it looks something like this. * index.html * node_modules * clarity-animationCopy the contents of this example and paste it into the index.html file. &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Script Tag Exmaple&lt;/title&gt; &lt;style&gt; .box { width: 100px; height:100px; border: 1px solid #000000; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;my-box&quot; class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;./node_modules/clarity-animation/dist/main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; var ElementAnimation = clarityAnimation.ElementAnimation; var box = document.querySelector(&quot;#my-box&quot;); var animation = new ElementAnimation({ target: box, properties: { backgroundColor: { from: &quot;rgba(0,0,0,0)&quot;, to: &quot;#ff0000&quot; } }, duration: 10000, easing: &quot;easeOutExpo&quot; }); animation.playToEndAsync(); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;Clarity Animation with ReactjsIn the root of your Reactjs folder install Clarity Animation with npm. npm install clarity-animation --saveNow that Clarity Animation is installed start using it in one of your components. import React, { Component } from &quot;react&quot;; import { CssAnimation } from &quot;clarity-animation&quot;; const myStyles = { backgroundColor: &quot;rgba(100,100,200,0.5)&quot;, width: &quot;100px&quot;, height: &quot;100px&quot; }; class MyComponent extends Component { constructor(props){ super(props); var animation = new CssAnimation({ target: myStyles, properties: { backgroundColor: { from: myStyles.backgroundColor, to: &quot;#ff0000&quot; } }, duration: 10000, easing: &quot;easeOutExpo&quot; }); animation.observe(&quot;tick&quot;, ()=&gt;{ this.forceUpdate(); }); this.animation = animation; } componentDidMount(){ this.animation.playToEndAsync().then(()=&gt;{ console.log(&quot;Finished Animation&quot;); }); } render(){ return ( &lt;div style={myStyles}&gt; Hello Animation! &lt;/div&gt; ); } }Requirejs with Clarity Animationnpm install clarity-animationAfter running the npm command, downloading requirejs , and adding a index.html file, the folder structure would look something like this. - index.html - require.js - node_modules -clarity-animationCopy the contents of this example and paste it into the index.html file. &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Using Animation&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;require.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; require([&quot;./node_modules/clarity-animation/dist/main.js&quot;], function(clarityAnimation){ var CssAnimation = clarityAnimation.CssAnimation; var target = { backgroundColor: &quot;#123456&quot; }; var animation = new CssAnimation({ target: target, properties: { backgroundColor: { from: target.backgroundColor, to: &quot;#ff0000&quot; } }, duration: 1000, easing: &quot;easeOutExpo&quot; }); animation.observe(&quot;tick&quot;, function(){ document.body.style.backgroundColor = target.backgroundColor; }); animation.playToEndAsync(); }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;DocumentationAnimation Easings linear (Default) easeInQuad easeOutQuad easeInOutQuad easeInCubic easeOutCubic easeInOutCubic easeInQuart easeOutQuart easeInOutQuart easeInQuint easeOutQuint easeInOutQuint easeInSine easeOutSine easeInOutSine easeInExpo easeOutExpo easeInOutExpo easeInCirc easeOutCirc easeInOutCirc easeInElastic easeOutElastic easeInOutElastic easeInBack easeOutBack easeInOutBack easeInBounce easeOutBounce easeInOutBounce RepeatingThere are two properties to control repeating. The first is the &quot;repeat&quot; property on the animation, and the &quot;repeatDirection&quot;. The &quot;repeat&quot; property controls how many times the animation will repeat. You can use &quot;Infinity&quot; to mean.... well infinity and any integer to express the amount of times you would like the animation to repeat. For &quot;repeatDirection&quot; you can use two values, 0 or 1. We have two static properties on the Animation class to help remember what is what. 0 is the default repeat which starts from the beginning, and 1 which is the alternating repeat. Alternating means that the animation will go back and forward like a swing. ... animation.repeat = Infinity; animation.repeatDirection = Animation.REPEAT_DEFAULT; ... // or animation.repeat = 10; animation.repeatDirection = Animation.REPEAT_ALTERNATE;AnimationThis class can animate any property on any object as long as its a number. If you would like to animate SVGs this is the class for you. var obj = { width: 0, height: 0 }; var animation = new clarityAnimation.Animation({ target: obj, properties: { width: { from: 0, to: 100 }, height: { from: 0, to: 100 } }, duration: 1000, easing: &quot;easeOutExpo&quot; });CustomRenderAnimationThis class allows you to decide how to render the current values. Check out the svg example. var animation = new clarityAnimation.CustomRenderAnimation({ renderer: (values)=&gt;{ Object.keys(values).forEach((propertyName)=&gt;{ svgCircle.setAttribute(propertyName, values[propertyName]); }); }, properties: { width: { from: 0, to: 100 }, height: { from: 0, to: 100 } }, duration: 1000, easing: &quot;easeOutExpo&quot; });ElementAnimationThis section will discuss the possibilities of ElementAnimation. List of Animatable Properties for ElementAnimation. width height lineHeight top right bottom left fontSize borderTopWidth borderBottomWidth borderRightWidth borderLeftWidth borderTopColor borderBottomColor borderLeftColor borderRightColor marginTop marginBottom marginLeft marginRight paddingTop paddingBottom paddingLeft paddingRight opacity color backgroundColor rotateX rotateY rotateZ scaleX scaleY scaleZ translateX translateY translateZ var div = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;); var animation = new ElementAnimation({ target: div, properties: { backgroundColor: { from: &quot;rgba(0,0,0,1)&quot;, to: &quot;rgba(100,0,100,0.5)&quot; } }, duration: 2000, easing: &quot;easeOutExpo&quot; });Timeline var div = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;); var div2 = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;); var opacityAnimation = new ElementAnimation({ target: div, properties: { opacity: { from: 0, to: 1 } }, duration: 2000, easing: &quot;easing&quot; }); var moveAnimation = new ElementAnimation({ target: div, properties: { left: { from: &quot;0px&quot;, to: &quot;100px&quot; } }, duration: 2000, easing: &quot;easeOutExpo&quot; }); moveDiv2Animation = new ElementAnimation({ target: div2, properties: { left: { from: &quot;100px&quot;, to: &quot;200px&quot; } }, duration: 2000, easing: &quot;easeOutExpo&quot; }); var timeline = new Timeline(); timeline.add({ animation: opacityAnimation, offset: 0 },{ animation: moveAnimation, offset: 0 },{ animation: moveDiv2Animation, offset: 0 }); timeline.play();PercentageTimelinePercentageTimeline really works well when thinking about a concert of animations. You just need to think about when something will start and finish. If you need an animation to start at the beginning and end half way through, and another animation to start half way through and end three quarters of the way through. This is the class for you. After deciding the composition, you can adjust the duration until its perfect. var div = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;); var div2 = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;); var opacityAnimation = new ElementAnimation({ target: div, properties: { opacity: { from: 0, to: 1 } }, duration: 2000, easing: &quot;easing&quot; }); var moveAnimation = new ElementAnimation({ target: div, properties: { left: { from: &quot;0px&quot;, to: &quot;100px&quot; } }, duration: 2000, easing: &quot;easeOutExpo&quot; }); moveDiv2Animation = new ElementAnimation({ target: div2, properties: { left: { from: &quot;100px&quot;, to: &quot;200px&quot; } }, duration: 2000, easing: &quot;easeOutExpo&quot; }); var timeline = new PercentageTimeline(2000); timeline.add({ animation: opacityAnimation, startAt: 0, endAt: 1 },{ animation: moveAnimation, startAt: 0, endAt: 0.5 },{ animation: moveDiv2Animation, startAt: 0.5, endAt: 1 }); timeline.play();Methods on Animations and Timelines.observe(type: string, callback )Observable Events start end tick play reverse stop pause restart ... animation.observe(&quot;tick&quot;, function(){ console.log(&quot;tick&quot;); }); ...play( )Plays the animation from its current position to the end. ... animation.play(); ...playToEndAsync( ):PromisePlays the animation from its current position to the end, and returns a Promise.
